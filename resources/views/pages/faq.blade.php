      <h3 class="question main-heading">Does my team have to be three people?</h3>
      <p class="answer">No! Your team can be 1, 2 or 3 people, but regardless of size you should bring 3 bottles of the selected wine for the tasting. If you want to come with a group of 5 or 6 ,that's great - the more the merrier! Just note that this would be two teams and you would need 6 bottles of wine!</p>

      <h3 class="question main-heading">How much does it cost?</h3>
      <p class="answer">Registration is free, but you should come to the event prepared to give a charitable donation to our sponsored charity! We ask a minimum of $20 but encourage you to give what you're comfortable with. This is a great organization doing amazing things in our community and every dollar that you gives goes directly to their mission! Additionally, each team (regardless of size) needs to bring 3 bottles of wine for the tasting. You can be a team of 1, 2 or 3 people!</p>

      <h3 class="question main-heading">What should I wear?</h3>
      <p class="answer">Our event is "Dress to Impress" but we realize some of you will be coming straight from work too! Don't let clothing options discourage you but feel free to get dressed up for the night if you like! Most girls will likely wear a dress or slacks and pants, men can wear business casual or a suit!</p>
